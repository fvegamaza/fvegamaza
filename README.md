## Welcome to my Github :D

Here I tried document my work in machile learning, and also share with you my level of experitise in this field.To make it simple. In each of my projects you'll find (I'll do my best to keep like this) the following three sections:

-"My experience through this" -> How I feel doing the project, what I need to do better and what were my lows and higs

-"Technical aspects" -> Here I try be the most technical as I can, summarizing the mainly aspects of my model

-"About the dataset" -> What difficulties I have found in the data, and also why does work or doesn't

All feedback will be welcome. 
I know this is a huga learning path to achieve good domain knowledge.
