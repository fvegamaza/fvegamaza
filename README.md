## Welcome to my Github :rainbow:

Here I try to document my work in machine learning and also share with you my experience in this field. To keep it simple, in each of my projects you'll find the following four sections:

- "What was about?" -> One sentence that summarizes the project

- "My experience through this" -> How I felt doing the project, what I need to do better and what were my lows and highs

- "Technical aspects" -> Here I try be the most technical as I can, summarizing the mainly aspects of my model

- "About the dataset" -> What difficulties I have found in the data and some explanations about it as well, also why did work or didn't

All feedbacks are welcome. 


If you want to see my Formal Education and that kind of information I strongly recommend you look on my [Linkedin Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/franco-vega-maza-/)
