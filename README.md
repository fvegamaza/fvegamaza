## Welcome to my Github :rainbow:

Here I try to document my work in machile learning, and also share with you my experitise in this field. To make it simple, in each of my projects you'll find (I'll do my best to keep it like this) the following three sections:

- "My experience through this" -> How I feel doing the project, what I need to do better and what were my lows and highs

- "Technical aspects" -> Here I try be the most technical as I can, summarizing the mainly aspects of my model

- "About the dataset" -> What difficulties I have found in the data, and also why does work or doesn't

All feedbacks are welcome. 


If you want to see my Formal Education and that kind of information I strongly recommend you look on my [Linkedin Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/franco-vega-maza-/)
